The data in this directory are used to generate a CCPN project residing in:

Tests/data/ccpn/1brv_cs_pk_2mdl.tgz

252 CS were read directly from BMRB file bmr4020.str (256).
4 CS for 8 PHE HD2/HE2, and TYR HD2 and HE2 were lost due to merging.
The Asn HD21/HD22 were changed from non-stereospecific to SSA which might be a FC bug?

nb3 is original FT spectrum.
brsvg_sparky.ucsf is spectrum in UCSF SPARKY format. Can be read by FC in Analysis
