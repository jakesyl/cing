The data in this directory are used to generate a CCPN project residing in:

Tests/data/ccpn/1brv_cs_pk_2mdl.tgz

The data were generated by CING's export2Xeasy using
$CINGROOT/python/cing/PluginCode/test/test_validate.py using the Regine data in:
/Users/jd/workspace35/cing/Tests/data/cyana/1brv_1model/1brv_1model.pkr

and can be read by FC.

But before the peaks are imported the spectrum needs to be properly referenced.

Look up a known peak in peak list and find the same peak in the spectrum.
Then adjust the spectrum referencing until the peak matches.
Then read the peak list etc.

Then do:
Import -> Combined files -> Chemical shifts and peaks -> Xeasy.
