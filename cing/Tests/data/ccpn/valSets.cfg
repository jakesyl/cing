# Validation settings.

# This file can be read by Python's ConfigParser
# The configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and
# followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations in the style of RFC 822;
# "name=value" is also accepted. Note that leading whitespace is removed from
# values. The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other
# values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.
# Additional defaults can be provided on initialization and retrieval. Lines
# beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments.

# JFD adds: values will be interpreted in order as floats, boolean, or string. A value of -999.9 has the
# special meaning in that it will be translated into a None value which will be interpreted so that the check
# is not performed.
