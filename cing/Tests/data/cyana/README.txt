NB some PDB files have been transformed to IUPAC by Yasara
	They can be recognized by looking for a $x_org.pdb file present.

1ai0: is a nice example for it's a divers molecular system.
    - Mol.Sys.  - 2 models (truncated to for speed reason)
                - 12 proteins (chains)
                - 6 ligands
                - 2 water molecules
                - 2 zinc ions
                - for in total 12 chains; the ligands, water and zinc is
                    not part of any chain.
     - Restraints   - 4391 various distance restraints of which 4239 were linked in
                        DOCR (part of the NMR Restraints Grid).
                    - TODO: actually add them to the project.


1brv:
    - small system of only 19 AA
    - 48 models (too many;-)

1hkt:
    - # Geerten's first structure in PDB
    - restraints from 1hks
    - DNA-BINDING DOMAIN OF DROSOPHILA HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (DBD HS TF)
    - monomeric 106 residues.
1i1s:
    - withdrawn entry discussed at: http://proteins.dyndns.org/Education/Validation

1ka3:
    - replaced by the authors in 2004 (new pdb entry 1tkv).
    - discussed at: http://proteins.dyndns.org/Education/Validation

1pdb:
    - generic pdb structure as example for something I forgot.

1tgq:
    - SG group structure now replaced by the dimeric interpretation in 2b95.

1tkv: replaced 1ka3

1y4o:
    - CESG group structure from Jikui Song. Nice dimer.

1YWUcdGMP:
    - user prelim data

2hgh:
    - larger system of a protein/RNA complex

2hm9:
    - entry from Nadia K.W.

H2_2Ca_53:
    - from Mark H. with 2 Ca. Demonstrated a bug in shiftx or core/molecule.py.
    - truncated to first 2 models.
