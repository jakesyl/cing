The optimalization needed to do all PDB entries instead of the NMR only is:

- Buy a 2 Tb disk?
- Include NMR related entries.
- Exclude many temporary files only saves 5 Mb on 47 Mb total for 1cjg for instance.
- Compression brings back 86 to 42 Mb (a factor of 2 only) because most is compressed image files anyway.
