The problemEntryList.csv contains problems that prevent an entry from ending up in the NRG-CING RDB. 
NB a problem with an NRG CCPN file can be overcome if the mmCIF file processes fine locally without restraints from NRG.

The referenced CING issue id is for an issue that is either unsolved or unfixed.
The file is read by nrgCing.py as to ignore the entry for most things.
