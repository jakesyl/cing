# Find the base pairs is done with find_pair, this creates an input file for the program analyze
find_pair pde0128.pdb pde0128.inp

# The program analyze then creates a file with a detailed analysis of the structure:

analyze pde0128.inp 
# Output
pde0128.out    # Contains all parameters (propeller, slide, roll, twist, backbone torsions etc.)
				# we can make plots from the values on a per bp basis, as well as H-bonding images

# additional output
auxiliary.par  	# not clear yet
bp_step.par		# Base pair step parameters, can be used for rendering
bp_helical.par	# Base pair helical parameters, can be used for rendering

# Both can be used with rebuild to create Calladine-Drew schematic images 

# The trick here is to create the proper orientation for display
# We can use frame_mol for this.....?

# First create an alchemy file
rebuild bp_step.par temp2.alc #[for one block per base-pair] 
rebuild -block2 bp_step.par temp2.alc #[for one block per base] 
# Now create an image, use s as scale factor
alc2img -al -s=18 temp2.alc temp2.ps 	# postscript
alc2img -ral -s=50 temp2.alc temp2.r3d	# Raster3D

pdb2img  # tried it, but gives some errors

# Rendering in Raster3D (not sure if this is needed...)
cat temp2.r3d | render -png temp2.png



cf_7methods.par  # PArameters derived using older methods, not needed for our purposes
ref_frames.dat
poc_haxis.r3d    # NOt created
stacking.pdb     # PDB file containing stacked basepairs
# can be used to create images using
mstack2img '-tlcdo -s=25' stacking.pdb 1 11 bdl084_

hstacking.pdb  # NO clue yet
        
dcmnfile # removes all the auxiliary files from the file system

# Use pymol for rendering??



Analysis   [Back to Top]
Using a high-resolution B-DNA dodecamer, bdl084 (Shui et al. (1998), Biochemistry, 37, pp. 8341-8355), as an example, the input and output files for the analysis program (analyze) are as follows:
	•	Input
	1.	bdl084.pdb: structure file in PDB format downloaded from the NDB/PDB
	2.	bdl084.inp: input file describing base-pairing patterns in the original PDB file, generated as follows: find_pair -t bdl084.pdb bdl084.inp
	•	Output (generated with: analyze bdl084.inp)
	1.	bdl084.out: detailed listing of various parameters
	2.	auxiliary.par: auxiliary parameters including phosphorus-phosphorus distance matrix, etc. Fixed file name: overwritten each time unless changed to a new name
	3.	bp_helical.par: base-pair and helical parameters (x-displacement, etc.) in a format suitable for rebuilding routines (e.g., rebuild)
	4.	bp_step.par: base-pair and step parameters (Roll, Slide etc.) in a format suitable for rebuilding routines
	5.	cf_7methods.par: parameters of the seven most frequently used nucleic acid analysis programs-CEHS, CompDNA, Curves, FreeHelix, NGEOM, NUPARM, RNA-calculated based on the standard reference frame. Note that the numerical values are very similar
	6.	ref_frames.dat: position and orientation of each base-pair reference frame, useful for re-orienting the structure with frame_mol
	7.	poc_haxis.r3d: global linear helical axis with average radii of P, O4' and C1' atoms for input to Raster3D.
	8.	hstacking.pdb: multiple structures in PDB format composed of each dinucleotide step with reference to its middle helical frame
	9.	stacking.pdb: multiple structures in PDB format composed of each dinucleotide step with reference to its middle step frame. Used for generating "standardized" stacking diagrams
