</head>
<body>
Install the requirements: Last updated on June 26th, 2009<br><br>
<ol><li><b>Setup Eclipse</b><BR>
Always start from command line instead of Dock/Taskbar so that it gets your environment settings such as
PRODIR for the PROCHECK_NMR installation.<br>
CING is being developed on Eclipse 3.4 with PyDev Extensions for automatic code analysis and organization.
ShellEd can be used in eclipse but version 1.0.3 fails whereas 1.0.2 works fine.<LI><b>Setup SVN  archive</b><BR>
Register with google code to get a user account. Configure Eclipse for SVN; for 3.4 follow instructions from: http://blog.punchbarrel.com/2008/06/30/using-the-new-subversion-integration-in-eclipse-ganymede/<br>Check out the CING project from SVN in Eclipse. <br>
This is a two wizard step process; first the SVN then the Pydev wizard.<br><br>
