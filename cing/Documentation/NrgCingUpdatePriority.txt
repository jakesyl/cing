Priority for updating NRG-CING

Priority of an entry is in the range [0,9] and is a float.

Once a week we do the X highest ranking entries. X=40 now.
When one resource updates all entries we limit the weekly load
to higher priorities using this automatic priority scheduling.

We may keep a few cores doing the lower scoring updates running in the cloud.
