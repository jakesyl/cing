- BASIC OPERATIONS

Configure apache: see 
Access: https://draccmbi21.cmbi.ru.nl/index.html using root account.
        draccmbi21 IP: 131.174.88.65
Reboot: System -> Power -> Power Cycle system (cold boot).
    
cmbi21 IP: 131.174.88.69 met jurgenfd access.
    ssh jurgenfd@cmbi21.cmbi.ru.nl
    Patch:
        yum clean all
        yum update

    virt-install -h
    su - (Use root password)
    tsclient works also with Mac OSX key bindings which fail with default virt-viewer.
    vncviewer localhost:5900 works and using the F8 pop-up menu can send ctrl-alt-f1 thru 7 needed for switching login screens.

Issues:
- Server room access in weekend?
- Four times a year a patch that takes less than half an hour of downtime.

Closed issues:
- Starting from VC 2011-11-01 which is a freshly updated Ubuntu 11.04 with 
    PAE and LVM2 extensions to kernel.
    - Converted from Mac OSX multiple vdmk files to single vdmk file:
        "/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/vmware-vdiskmanager" -r VC.vmdk -t 4 CVCa.vdmk
        Note that this file is excellent to restore from again inside Mac OSX VMware Fusion.
        Just run the File -> New VM Assistent and start without iso and then select the vdmk file and
            OS type. 
                        
- Adding five 1 Tb partitions that Linux can see a one disk.
    
- Set fixed IP address in 
       
    
- Setting up a new VM on cmbi21 as root:
    cd /var/lib/libvirt/images
    # CVCa stands for CMBI Virtual Cing machine a.
    qemu-img convert -O raw CVCa.vmdk CVCa.raw
    # No idea why:
    chcon --reference VC.qcow2 CVCa.raw; 
    # Unknown why these option.
    ls -alrtZ
    # Anything running
    virsh list --all
    # Save previous instance settings
    virsh dumpxml VC > VC_vers20111107.xml
    # Kill previous instance to virsh. Will not remove the VM image.
    virsh undefine VC
    # Install from converted image (.raw file)
    virt-install --name CVCa --cpuset=auto --import --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/CVCa.raw --accelerate \
        --network network:default --ram 15000 --vnc --vcpus=8 --os-variant=ubuntumaverick
    # Save settings again
    virsh dumpxml CVCa > CVCA_vers20111107.xml
    
After a reboot make sure the following services run on the server:

Jurgen's setup
- CING website:    http://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/cing (checked from Madison every 12").
- iCing javascript https://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/icing (checked from Madison).
- iCing servlet    https://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/icing/serv/iCingServlet (checked from Madison).
- psql see psql_setup_instructions.txt

OPTIONAL:
- mysql (needed by fcweb and by NRG)
    TODO: fails the automatic startup even though the System Preferences Gui says it should. The console shows a message
            saying mysql should be upgraded to create a required file. Probably to do with change from case-sensitive
            FS to case aware FS. Since it is not yet essential skipped for now.
    Workaround: start by hand from System Preferences.

Geerten's setup
- proteins website: http://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl (checked from Madison).
- mac fusion (check by hand by doing Finder->Connect to server-> https://proteins.dyndns.org/gDisk
    Unable to check from a remote site yet. Can't do a scp or a ssh to https://proteins.dyndns.org/gDisk

    
MAINTENANCE (security updates and all)
# Shutdown the VM if not in use. As user i on nmr:
sudo shutdown -h now
# Wait for the VM to shutdown
as root on cmbi21:
yum clean all
yum update 
# and answer y (This installed 42 packages in 5 minutes) on Feb. 2, 2012.
# Reboot the host OS as jurgenfd on host.
sudo reboot --debug
# This takes several (~10) minutes. And can be followed from the screen capture at:
https://draccmbi21.cmbi.ru.nl
Make sure that the jnlp link when saved has the .jnlp extension. I had to rename it manually.
# Update firmwares

TODO: (when Dell is back up).
Using our servicetag (Chassis Service Tag HM1J45J, Express Service Code  38338127047) at:
(Service tag is unknown at the US dell site.)
http://http://support.euro.dell.com -> enterprise
 
look for new drivers and downloads.
Compare the installed firmwares to the info from Dell OpenManage (Firefox): 

https://cmbi21.cmbi.ru.nl:1311

The firmwares that can be updated include:
    bios
    diskcontroller
    drac (niet updaten vanuit drac console!)
    lifecyclecontroller

and opitonally:
    disksfirmwares and networkcards if urgent
NB
Don't do all at once.
First the host OS update then reboot and check functionality.
Then firmwares.

Day 1 Feb 6, 2012
- Finding Firmware updates and putting them in:
/root/dell/firmware. Make sure the .bin downloaded files are executable.
Downgrading is possible. thru website downloadable packages.
Installer ought to check the update applicability.
Updates
     Bios                  3.0     to 6.1.0
     DRAC/ESM              1.7     to 1.8
     Firmware              N/A
     Lifecycle Controller  1.5.0.671 to 1.5.1.57 
     Network               Not done. Usually not updated; just when critical or recommended.
     OS                    Is done using yum inside host OS
     Power                 Not done.
     Removable Storage     Not done.
     SAS Drive             Not done. The drive ids can be found from Storage-> Perc700/Conn 0/Enclosure/Physical Disks/Full View
                            ST32000444SS
     SAS RAID              H700 1210.1-001 -> 1210.2-004.     
     Rest                  Not done because N/A.
     
Day 2 Feb 7, 2012
Disable autorestart VMs for updates that will require reboot.
    virsh autostart --disable CVCa
   
-1- First DRAC update
    Use "screen" so hangups don't cause underlying update to hang up as well.
    Check website DRAC after install. No restart required.
    Got "Failed to access virtual USB Device" and version of DRAC persisted.
    Detached the device from within DRAC and reapplied patch.
    Log out from DRAC before trying to update it again.
    2nd try was successful.
-2- BIOS update 
    Look at DRAC -> System -> Console Media -> Launch Virtual Console (fails on OSX in any browser).
    Quota check is ok to fail.
    Reboot takes about 3"
-3- Dell Open Manage software
    Need to stop several services by hand.
        omconfig system webserver action = stop
        /etc/init.d/dataeng stop (or alike)
-4- Lifecycle controller 
    Takes about 10".
  
Reenable autostart again. virsh autostart CVCa

NB The DRAC remote console fails to download from Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.

MAINTENANCE nmr VM
 - sudo su
 - apt-get update
 - apt-get upgrade
 - Some packages are held back because they are more invasive; e.g. kernel updates. The below will update them anyway.
   This is a good time to consider the state of the backups. ;-)
    apt-get dist-upgrade
