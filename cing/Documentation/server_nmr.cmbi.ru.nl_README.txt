After a reboot make sure the following services run on the server:

Jurgen's setup
- CING website:     http://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/cing (checked from Madison every 12"). 
- iCing javascript https://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/iCing (checked from Madison).
- iCing servlet    https://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/iCing/serv/iCingServlet (checked from Madison).
- mysql (needed by fcweb and by NRG)
    TODO: fails the automatic startup even though the System Preferences Gui says it should. The console shows a message
            saying mysql should be upgraded to create a required file. Probably to do with change from case-sensitive 
            FS to case aware FS. Since it is not yet essential skipped for now.
    Workaround: start by hand from System Preferences.        
- fcweb (checked from Madison).
   TODO: fails the automatic startup after reboot. Solution by hand:
   launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/fcweb.plist
   launchctl   load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/fcweb.plist
