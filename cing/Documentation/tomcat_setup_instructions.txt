THIS DOCUMENT IS NOW MAINTAINED IN THE CING PACKAGE.

* Note  http://www.malisphoto.com/tips/tomcatonosx.html
    Has most up to date instructions.
    
* On Stella/mini (mac):
-Using mac installed version (Apache Tomcat/5.5.23):
    as root
    export CATALINA_HOME=/Library/Tomcat
	$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh
	$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh
	
- Logs:
	tail -f $CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out  &
- Webapps:x
	$CATALINA_HOME/webapps
	
	
- NOT DONE YET: add a proxy port in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml:
    <Connector
      className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"
      port="8080"
      proxyPort="80"
    > 
    Add the proxyPort setting to the Connector tag in your server.xml.
	And to the apache setup with proxies?	
	
# Fink specific	
    setenv CATALINA_HOME /sw/var/tomcat5
- Status:
	ps -a | grep TOMCAT5LAUNCH | grep -v grep 


- Use fink installed apache tomcat5 
	
- Restart:
	/sw/bin/tomcat5 restart

    
    /sw/etc/tomcat5/tomcat.conf (just one file here)
    /sw/share/webapps
    
    
    
    
- Then configure Apache such that it will forward the requests on 80 to 8080:
    http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/proxy-howto.html and the apache
    setup instructions in this local dir.
    
* New installation of NRG31 on tang:
    * only changed 'WebModule' to 'NRG' from the below. Keeping all ports the same.
    * put web.xml in: /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/NRG/WEB-INF (no changes from old one needed)

* servlet engine Apache Tomcat/5.5.20 installed on tang
    * port 8080 but redirection from standard port 80 should occur as per above for Stella.
    * tomcat:x:151:101:Tomacat web user:/share/tomcat:/sbin/nologin
        not allowed to be a login-able user. 
    * CATALINA_HOME /usr/share/tomcat5
    * -/conf Configuration but only change:
            /servlet_data/ diff -w /usr/share/tomcat5/conf/tomcat5.conf*
            27c27
            < JAVA_OPTS="-Dcatalina.ext.dirs=/usr/share/tomcat5/shared/lib:/usr/share/tomcat5/common/lib"
            ---
            > JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dcatalina.ext.dirs=$CATALINA_HOME/shared/lib:$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib"
    
    * /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/NRG/WEB-INF/lib Place for jars.
    * OLD /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/WebModule/WEB-INF/lib Place for jars.

    * /etc/init.d/tomcat5 restart
    * For now use old setup in: 
-       rwxr--r-- 1 jurgen users 1570717 Jan 19 10:25 /share/wattos/Wattos/lib/Wattos.jar*
    * Access logs configured in:/conf/server.xml. Note that the filename format
        seems to be unconfigurable to do by week but is ok.
            <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve"
                 directory=".."  prefix="access_log." suffix=".txt"
                 pattern="combined" resolveHosts="false"/>

     * disabling default servlet icon etc.:
        cd /usr/share/tomcat5/webapps/ROOT
        cp /var/www/html/index.html .
        cp /bmrb/htdocs/favicon.ico .
        touch robots.txt


--- OLD ---

* servlet engine tomcat 5.5.4 now installed on halfbeak
    * /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat/conf Configuration
    * Fix jsvc:
        - follow instructions in INSTALL.txt and patch for the differences
            with java sdk's using google's answers.
                * no need to comment the set_caps.
                * add the new paths to java resources.
    * /etc/init.d/tomcat stop; /etc/init.d/tomcat start
        which needs to be done as root because it won't run under tomcat user.
        The startup is automated (and tested) to start under run level 5 (default run level on tang)
        and killed on all levels
        through invocation in /etc/rc.d:
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           16 Dec 14 16:42 /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/K19tomcat -> ../init.d/tomcat
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           16 Dec 14 16:39 /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S98tomcat -> ../init.d/tomcat
        Tomcat starts after the mysql daemon and stops before mysqld stops.
    * jsvc is the program that is the tomcat daemon and it runs under
        root and another part under tomcat user names.        
    * access logs in: 
        /var/log/tomcat (up to date)
        /bmrb/admin/logs/tang/mrgridservlets/access_log.2004-12.txt etc. (old)
    * access and error logs in:
        /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat/logs/catalina.err and out.
    * version similar to the tomcat 5.0.19 installation that comes with NetBeans 
        (on windows for JFDs development machine)
    * the internal administration features aren't installed for safety.
    * There are additional log files from before 2005 that tracked access when the servlets were
        still running on a machine different than tang or halfbeak. During that time there were around
        a little less than 324,804 requests for /servlets/MRGridServlet.
    * Robots like:
        72.30.132.34 - - [01/Jun/2006:00:07:29 -0600] "GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.0" 404 983 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Yahoo! Slurp; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp)"
        they caused a large overhead; 3 million requests in 9 months for tomcat alone.
