    There's one in eclipse and fink but heck why not shrew up the one in mac os integrated.
    On leopard which has apache 2:
        vi /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf

    Php support, needed for NRG-CING pdb code lookup:
        enable in config the line:
        LoadModule php5_module        libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
    Redirect old cased icing url in apache's settings (Thanks to: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/ApacheRedirect.html)
        Redirect permanent /iCing /icing
    
monitor with:
	tail -f /private/var/log/apache2/*_log &

# For the gwt tomcat server
ProxyPass         /icing/serv http://localhost:8080/icing
ProxyPassReverse  /icing/serv http://localhost:8080/icing

The tomcat server in eclipse works together with the apache configured here.

# For the NRG tomcat web app.
ProxyPass         / http://localhost:8080/NRG/MRGridServlet
ProxyPassReverse  / http://localhost:8080/NRG/MRGridServlet
