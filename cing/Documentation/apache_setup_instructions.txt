* apache on mac
    There's one in eclipse but heck why not shrew up the one in mac os integrated.
    On leopard which has apache 2:
        /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf and
        /private/etc/apache2/users/jd.conf

'HOME', '/Users/jd/Sites/tmp/cing'
ErrorLog /private/var/log/apache2/error_log

monitor with:
tail -f /private/var/log/apache2/*_log &

- processing is done as _www:admin account.
    So don't use the suEXEC way.

        The tomcat server in eclipse works together with the apache configured here.
