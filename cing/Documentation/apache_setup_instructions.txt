* apache on mac
    There's one in eclipse but heck why not shrew up the one in mac os integrated.
    On leopard which has apache 2 instead of 1, look for the settings file httpd.conf in: 

'HOME', '/Users/jd/Sites/tmp/cing'
ErrorLog /private/var/log/apache2/error_log

monitor with:
tail -f /private/var/log/apache2/*_log &

- allow indexing on home dirs and beyond for  e.g.:
    http://tang.bmrb.wisc.edu/~jurgen/tmp/Aqua/900971/
    by including settings:<Directory /home/*/external_html> in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

- processing is done as _www:admin user:group account.
    So don't use the suEXEC way.
