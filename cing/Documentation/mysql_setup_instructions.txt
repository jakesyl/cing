* New setup with mysql 5.1 from mac ports. Start a regular and a root user window then.
    As jd:
    - sudo port install mysql5-server
    - set mysqldatadir=/opt/local/var/db/mysql5/
    As root (bash):
    - export mysqldatadir=/opt/local/var/db/mysql5/
    - rm -rf $mysqldatadir
    - chown -R mysql:_mysql /opt/local/var/db
    As jd:
    - sudo -u _mysql mysql_install_db5
    - sudo /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysqld_safe &
    As root:
    - cd $mysqldatadir;  tail -f *.err *.log &
    As jd:
    - /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 4I4KMS
    - mysql -u root -p'4I4KMS' mysql
    - run db_setup.sql and the mentioned db_create.sql
    - Start/stop: mysqlstart/mysqlstop
    - Install per instructions in tomcat_setup_instructions.txt
    - Run servlet-wattos-new-install target in buildEclipse.xml in the Wattos project to get the tomcat webapp up.
    - Setup proxies in apache in /private/etc/apache2/other/cing.conf as described in apache_setup_instructions.txt.

* mysql on nmr OLD
    * To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

If you set a password it might be more hard. Simpler to disable root password... at your own risk.
PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
/sw/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/sw/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h nmr.cmbi.umcn.nl password 'new-password'
See the manual for more instructions.

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl


* mysql under fink on Mac (Currently 5.0.38-1005)
    fink install mysql
    daemonic enable mysql (only once). Tested fine. It installs:
        /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-mysql/daemonic-mysql
    Which benefits from an added stop command:
          stop)\
            ConsoleMessage "Stopping MySQL database server"
            killall mysqld_safe mysqld
            ;;
    Defined datadir is:
        set mysqldatadir = /sw/var/mysql
        cd $mysqldatadir
    Get the config file:
        cp /sw/share/mysql/my-innodb-heavy-4G.cnf my.cnf
    Remove the mysql data out of the way for inno to take it's new settings:
        rm ibdata1 ib_logfile*

    DON'T SET THE ROOT PASSWORD BECAUSE I DON'T KNWO HOW TO CONFIGURE ALL TO WORK THEN.
    Seems like I can't login as root with mysql when I'm not logged in as root under the OS.

    RESTART:
        # Funny thing is that logging into mysql as root can only be done as Unix root user.
            mysqladmin --user root -p'\!Ecj%Y&R' status
            mysqladmin --user root -p'\!Ecj%Y&R' --shutdown_timeout=10 shutdown
        or
            /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-mysql/daemonic-mysql stop
        Never use kill -9. Only regular kill or killall is safe.
        Then:
            /Library/StartupItems/daemonic-mysql/daemonic-mysql start
    Connect:
        mysql --user wattos1 -p4I4KMS wattos1
        mysql --user root wattos1
        mysqladmin --user root status
    LOG:
        tail -f $mysqldatadir/stella.err &
        tail -f /var/log/system.log

    CONFIG:
        /sw/share/mysql/my-innodb-heavy-4G.cnf original to be copied to /sw
    PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
    To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:
        /sw/bin/mysqladmin -u root password ''
    or if it was misset before:
        /sw/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p4I4KMS password '\!Ecj%Y&R'





* mysql engine installed on Stella 5.1.20-beta MySQL Community Server (GPL)
    * See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mac-os-x-installation.html
    * datadir=/usr/local/mysql-5.1.20-beta-osx10.4-i686/data (changed from: /var/lib/mysql)

        wattos2     wattos database although since they are innodb

                        files in the datadir.

* integration with Eclipse is thru: mysql-connector-java-5.0.3.jar
    - Make sure the data tools are installed. Install thru:
        Help->Software Install->new->Europa Discovery Site->data tools or something
        Add the driver from Wattos/lib. Doesn't need to match exact version of db installed..
            Test it with pinging until connection made.
        Then in Eclipse still In Data Source Explorer, new connection profile.
            select the driver and it's settings from previous steps.
        Open an SQL file like from Wattos/scripts/sql
        Connect it to db from above step.
        Highlight a text and right click select 'Execute Selected Text'
        Results will appear in tab for 'SQL Results'

In order to access the mysql db over ssh see:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/windows-and-ssh.html
worked by setting connection parameters to localhost:33061
and tunnel with securecrt with in: 33061 and out tang:3306
