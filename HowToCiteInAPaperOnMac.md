# Versions #

  * Word 2004 for Mac, v 11.3.8 (070817)
  * Endnote X1
  * Papers 1.9.1

# Procedure #

  * In Papers select (File -> Export ->
  * In Endnote
    * select all and delete.
    * select (File -> Import) using EndNote Generated XML/Import All/ANSEL settings.
  * In Word
    * Disable any automatic features like: Instant Formatting, Cite While You Write. They're a CPU hog.
    * Use the cite style: {Doreleijers, 2005,p668}. The number after the p is known in Papers as part of the **citekey**. It does not change when cycling the above procedure whereas the reference id in Endnote that can be called by Word's # sign does.
    * So in Word just type the reference in by hand, looking up the ids in Papers.
    * Then when building the reference list resolve any mismatches by updating in Papers and temporarily ignoring them in the Word doc. Don't use the # numbers that the plugin will put in.
